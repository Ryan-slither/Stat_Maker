# Stats_Maker
 - GUI for making Bar and Scatter plots
 - Uses Numpy, Pandas, Tkinter, and Matplotlib

# How To Use
To make scatter or bar plots you must choose data to plot. All other settings are optional besides the color and tick size which have default values (tick size is recommended to be unchanged). For manipulating data you can create a new column that contains the percent change from one column to another. The new column is added to the first data set chosen.
